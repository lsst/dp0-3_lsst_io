This is a template _static/README file (no extension) within the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Documentation for Data Preview 0.3 (DP0.3) documentation project. This template can be used for a _static directory's README, but there is a different README template all other directories.

Before creating a new _static directory, consider if it's appropriate to utilize the top-level _static directory or another _static directory from a higher level directory.

Note: The lines above and proceeding blank line may be deleted after the file is copied within the destination directory.

This _static/README includes information on using static objects within this directory, part of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Documentation for Data Preview 0.3 (DP0.3) documentation project. Do not reproduce static files in multiple _static directories; instead, use the appropriate reST syntax and/or symbolic links.

To use static files, add the file (png, svg or jpeg preferred for images) to this _static directory. The reST syntax for adding the image from this _static directory is:

.. figure:: ./_static/filename.ext
    :name: fig-label
    :target: http://target.link/url

    Caption text.

Symbolic links can be used for common static objects:

1. Create a symbolic link in the _static directory of the lower level directory. (Syntax: $ln -s [TARGET] LINK_NAME)

   $ ln -s ../../_static/filename.ext EXAMPLE_LINK

2. The reST syntax for adding the linked image is:

.. figure:: ./_static/EXAMPLE_LINK
    :name: fig-label

    Caption text.
