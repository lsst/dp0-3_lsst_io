This is a template README file (no extension) within the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Documentation for Data Preview 0.3 (DP0.3) documentation project. This template can be used for a directory's README, but there is a different README template for a _static directory.

To create a new directory:

1. Copy template-folder to the destination, then rename appropriately.

2. Contribute to the README. The file should describe the purpose of the directory with directions on contributing and releasing.

3. Determine if a _static directory is needed. If so, contribute to the _static/README (provided in template-folder).

Note: The lines above and proceeding blank line may be deleted after the file is copied within the destination directory.

This README includes information on this directory, part of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Documentation for Data Preview 0.3 (DP0.3) documentation project.

See https://dp0-3.lsst.io/project/contributing.html for details on contributing to the document project.
