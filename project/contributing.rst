.. Review the README on instructions to contribute.
.. Review the style guide to keep a consistent approach to the documentation.
.. Static objects, such as figures, should be stored in the _static directory. Review the _static/README on instructions to contribute.
.. Do not remove the comments that describe each section. They are included to provide guidance to contributors.
.. Do not remove other content provided in the templates, such as a section. Instead, comment out the content and include comments to explain the situation. For example:
	- If a section within the template is not needed, comment out the section title and label reference. Do not delete the expected section title, reference or related comments provided from the template.
    - If a file cannot include a title (surrounded by ampersands (#)), comment out the title from the template and include a comment explaining why this is implemented (in addition to applying the ``title`` directive).

.. This is the label that can be used for cross referencing this file.
.. Recommended title label format is "Directory Name"-"Title Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. _Project-Contributing:
.. Each section should include a label for cross referencing to a given area.
.. Recommended format for all labels is "Title Name"-"Section Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. To reference a label that isn't associated with an reST object such as a title or figure, you must include the link and explicit title using the syntax :ref:`link text <label-name>`.
.. A warning will alert you of identical labels during the linkcheck process.

.. This section should provide a brief, top-level description of the page.

Below are instructions and guidelines on contributing to the :doc:`Rubin Observatory Documentation for DP0.3 </index>`.
This documentation is built with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__ and published to :doc:`https://dp0-3.lsst.io </index>`.

This documentation is open source.
Rubin Observatory welcomes contributions that make this documentation more useful and accurate.


.. _Contributing-Issue:

Raising an issue

If you spot an issue with the documentation, the best thing to do is `raise a GitHub issue in the dp0-3_lsst_io repo <https://github.com/lsst/dp0-3_lsst_io/issues/new>`__.
Include any relevant URLs with your issue description.


.. _Contributing-PR:

Creating a pull request (PR)
============================

You can contribute directly to the `dp0-3_lsst_io repo <https://github.com/lsst/dp0-3_lsst_io>`__ by creating a pull request (PR).
If you’re intending to make a substantial change, it’s a good idea to create a GitHub issue first with your proposal.
Rubin Observatory can’t accept contributions that don’t fit with our strategy and roadmap.

  * :ref:`Contributing-Doc-Style-Guide`


.. _Contributing-Building-the-Docs:

Building the documentation locally
==================================

These are the basic steps to clone and build the docs:

#. Clone the GitHub repository:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      git clone https://github.com/lsst/dp0-3_lsst_io
      cd dp0-3_lsst_io

#. Create a Python virtual environment (with `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`__, for example):

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      python3 -m venv .venv
      source .venv/bin/activate

   .. note::
      Activate this virtual environment in another shell by re-running the ``source`` command.

#. Install the Python dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

#. You are now able to edit the cloned repository.
   The remaining items below are commands used to build and validate the documentation.
   These commands must be executed from the top-level directory.

#. Build the site:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      make html

   .. note::
      Open ``_build/html/index.html`` in a browser to review it.

#. Validate the documentation build:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      make linkcheck

   .. note::
      If some links are behind a login, you might need to ignore them.
      Look at the ``ignore`` variable in the the ``[sphinx.linkcheck]`` table in ``documenteer.toml`` for examples of how to do this.

#. Completely clear the build:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      make clean

   .. note::
      An error will alert you of identical labels during the build process.


.. _Contributing-Deployment:

Deployment
==========

Whenever you push to the GitHub repository, the site is built for the corresponding branch.
Find your build at https://dp0-3.lsst.io/v/. You can push to a branch you've created at any time.

The ``main`` branch is always published as :doc:`https://dp0-3.lsst.io </index>`. Only authorized individuals can merge to ``main`` (may be delegated).
To incorporate your suggestions, create a :ref:`pull request <contributing-pr>`.

Approval process
----------------

#. Verify the content with all authors and contributors.

#. Create a PR.

#. Request the following to review the PR (additional reviewers may be included in the process):
   
   * Melissa Graham
   * Leanne Guy

#. Respond to the comments received during the review process.

#. After all reviewers approve, the submitter will squash commits and merge to main.

#. Notify Melissa Graham or Leanne Guy the PR was merged.

#. Notify the authorized individual to tag the release.
