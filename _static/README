This _static/README includes information on using static objects within the top-level directory of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Documentation for Data Preview 0.3 (DP0.3).

To use static files, add the file (png, svg or jpeg preferred for images) to this _static directory. The reST syntax for adding the image from the top-level directory is:

.. figure:: _static/filename.ext
    :name: fig-label
    :target: http://target.link/url

    Caption text.

The _static/README in lower level directories should include instructions for static objects within that directory.

See https://dp0-3.lsst.io/project/contributing.html for details on contributing to the document project.
